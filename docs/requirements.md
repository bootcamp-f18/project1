# Project 1: Campaign Website

Create a website promoting your favorite FICTIONAL character from a book, TV show, movie, or graphic novel
who is running for the elected position of Constable in your magistrate district of Fayette County. (There
are 3 such districts.)

Briefly research the role of Constable, then design a political website for your chosen character. Here's
a link to get you started:

## Objectives and requirements

To complete the assignment, you must:

1. Create a public repo in your personal Github account.
2. Create an HTML file and an SCSS file and add them to your project.
3. Set up Sass to convert your Sass code into CSS.
4. Write instructions in your README for converting your Sass file(s) to CSS.
5. Push your code to Github.
6. Set up Github Pages to publish your website.
7. Post links to your Github repo and Github Pages website on your student page in the Class Notes repo. (You don't need to wait for +2 to merge this small change to dev.)

You may use Bootstrap for basic styling and incorporate it into your Sass file.


## Content

Your website should introduce the public to your candidate, explain why they are running, and list
three issues that are important to them.

Your job is to make it easy for voters to see whether your candidate's beliefs align with their own.

To keep things light and fun, pick issues that pertain to the character in their fictional setting, not
the real world. :-)

Remember to include a prominent picture of your candidate and a call to action - election day is November 6!



## Application file structure

Minimally:

```
  index.html - menu page
  main.scss - stylesheet
  README.md
  package.json
```

Make sure there's something to read in your README file - namely, installation instructions.

It's okay if your project has more files and more directories, but at the least you need the ones listed above.



## Remember to push to Github!

Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.




## If you finish early...

Continue to add content and pages to your site and improve the styling.



## If you get stuck...

Ask. :-)
